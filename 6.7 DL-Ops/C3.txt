1. Dataset: Has three components:
1.1 Organization
1.2 Loading of the Data
1.3 Using the data

N C H W - batch_size, channels, height, width

nn.eval() - very important to avoid drop out


Assignment:
1. Three layer architecture
MNIST, CIPHER10, CIPHER100

Network 1:
ReLU, leakyRELU, Sigmoid, with SGD, Adam optimizer

Network 2:
Add drop out where ReLU will be there with Adam


2. Choose an architecture of MLP network to classify images of those datasets
3. Train the network, test the network with their respective models
4. Explore ReLU, LeakyReLU, sigmoid
5. Explore different kinds of optimizers: SGD, Adam
6. Three loss functions: CrossEntropyLoss
7. Include Dropout in network and omit the dropout the network
8. Report the results in the excel sheet
9.
